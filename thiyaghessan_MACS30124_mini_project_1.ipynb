    "In this mini project, I explore the evolution of extremist conspiracy theories by scraping the contents of the InfoWars website. Extremist conspiracy theories are defined as theories that promote both conspiratorial beliefs and extremist political ideologies. I chose to investigate InfoWars due to its status as one of the most popular and influential far-right conspiracy websites in the United States. \n",

    "2. infowars_scraper() Works with pages scraped by the function in (1), further scraping article headlines, links and their associated contents. For hyperlinks provided between 2016 and 2021, the content also includes the authors of the website.\n",
    "3. format_infowars_archive(). For pre-2016 articles, this function takes the output of (2) and further cleans it, extracting the names of authors from the article contents and appending them to a new column\n",
    "4. read_json(). Reads any resultant jason files as a pandas dataframe for use in analysis\n",

Gen. Mohammad-Baqer Zolqadr a senior military official, as saying on Wednesday.\\nHe played down the threats made by Israel against Iran and said: “The Israeli regime is too weak to launch any attack on a great power like Iran.”\\n \\nZolqadr added that all Muslim nations would back Iran against its enemies if a military action were launched against it.\\n“If aggressive powers wage a war against Iran, certainly they will not be able to determine when the war will end and it will be up to the Iranian nation to determine such a war’s outcome,” he noted.\\n“The Iranian nation has always proved that they will make history in defending their country against the enemies,” Zolqadr concluded.\\nThe remarks were made at a time when the US and its allies are stepping up pressure against Iran over its nuclear activities. While the West has been accusing the country of developing nuclear weapons, Tehran maintains that its nuclear activities are aimed at civilian purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n//'"
