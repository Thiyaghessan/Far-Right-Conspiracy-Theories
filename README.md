# Far-Right-Conspiracy-Theories
Folder for Computational Analysis of Social Processes

In this repository I have three mini projects tracing the evolution of far-right conspiracy theories online

Mini project 1: Web scraper using Wayback Machine API scraping the contents of Infowars.com

Mini project 2: Text Analysis of scraped articles to identify core themes

Mini project 3: Modelling spread of misinformation online with interactive agent-based model \n
Mini project 3 comes with an attached.py file with utility functions used in the notebook
