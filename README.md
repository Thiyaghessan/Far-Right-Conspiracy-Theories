# Far-Right-Conspiracy-Theories
Folder for Computational Analysis of Social Processes

In this repository I have three mini projects tracing the evolution of far-right conspiracy theories online

Thiyaghessan_MACS30124_mini_project_1.ipynb: In this mini project I build a web scraper that calls the Wayback Machine API to scrape the Infowars.com website

mini_project_2.ipynb: After I have scraped Infowars.com and saved my scraped data to a .json file, I perform a text analysis on the scraped articles.

Interactive_Game_Conspiracy_Theories.ipynb: An interactive game that models the spread of conspiracy theories on social media networks

Conspiracy.py: File with helper functions for the interactive game above
